            <h2>Rental Contracts</h2>
            <p>Details on understanding and creating rental contracts. This section can include common terms, legal requirements, and tips for both landlords and tenants.</p>
            <h3>Firstly, did you know?</h3>
            <p>The Ontario government mandates that all rental contracts must use the standard lease template provided by the provincial government. This is to safeguard the rights of both tenants and landlords. The standard contract is clear and comprehensive, covering various possible scenarios in the leasing relationship, ensuring transparency and fairness in transactions for both parties.</p>
            <h4>üîë Key Point 1: Term of Lease</h4>
            <p>This section will specify whether your lease is for a fixed term (such as one year) or month-to-month. It's important to note the terms after the lease ends and understand the conditions for automatic renewal.</p>
            <h4>üîë Key Point 2: Rent Details</h4>
            <p>How much is the rent? When is it due? What are the payment methods? These must be clearly stated in the contract. Additionally, Ontario has regulations regarding rent increases, which should not be overlooked.</p>
            <h4>üîë Key Point 3: Maintenance and Repair Responsibilities</h4>
            <p>Clarifying the maintenance and repair responsibilities of both the landlord and tenant is crucial. Typically, minor repairs and upkeep are the tenant's responsibility, while major repairs should be handled by the landlord.</p>
            <h4>üìù Practical Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before signing the contract, be sure to read each clause carefully to understand every provision.</li>
                <li>If there are any uncertainties, don't hesitate to consult with the landlord or a professional.</li>
                <li>Remember to keep a copy of the contract. It will be an essential document in case of any disputes in the future.</li>
            </ul>
